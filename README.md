# Portfolio Page

This is a page that I will show to potential employers to highlight some of
the applications that I have completed.

## How to Use

- Open the **index.html** file with your browser
- Click on the **VIEW** hyper-links in the Featured Work section to view the
  github repository for that project

## Important Note

- Alternatively, this code can be run by entering the following command:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080

```

- This command will start a server on port 8080 of your local machine. To view
  the page, type **http://localhost:8080** into your url window in your browser.

## Dependencies

- Updated web browser
- python (if using the SimpleHTTPServer command)

## Relevant Links

- [python installation](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
